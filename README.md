# Shiro [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/Marc3842h/shiro/tree/master.svg?style=svg&circle-token=0fa5a9831ee745859ebeda892af66705bb0443b9)][0]

Shiro is a server-side implementation of the osu! cho protocol.
It delivers unmatched performance and features an accurate implementation
of the protocol.

It outperforms Ripple, Gigamons and even Bancho itself.
In terms of implementation accuracy, Shiro's implementation is
more accurate than both of Ripple and Gigamons.

Unlike other implementations, Shiro does not seperate
Bancho and the Score Submission server.

Currently WIP, may work but some features are not doing well...
Also ripple_migration replaced with full_schema
Can be used with [Aru](https://github.com/Rynnya/Aru)
